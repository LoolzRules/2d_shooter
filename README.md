# 2d shooter
Welcome!
I'm making top-down tactical multiplayer shooter that can be played in browser.
This is my side project that helps me to learn Typescript and software engineering in general.
Game engine is Phaser 3, networking is covered by Socket.io.
Please keep in mind that this project is WIP, there is a lot of things that need to be implemented.
