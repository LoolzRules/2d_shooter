# 2d shooter
Welcome!

I'm making top-down tactical multiplayer shooter that can be played in browser.
This is my side project that helps me to learn Typescript and software engineering in general.
Game engine is Phaser 3, networking is covered by Socket.io.
Please keep in mind that this project is WIP, there is a lot of things that need to be implemented.

To run this project locally you should have NodeJS installed.
Simply clone the repo and run the following commands:
- `npm install` to install all dependencies;
- `npm build` to build game files;
- `npm start` to start the server.

Updates are regularly uploaded to https://loolzshooter.herokuapp.com
